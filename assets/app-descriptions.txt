Bayyina

Short Description: 
==================

Automatically receive notifications about bayans uploaded to selected sources. 


Full Description: 
=================


Bayyina is a small app with one objective: to allow you to download bayans from 
selected sources. You may add sources to the list. (These sources have to support 
the bayyina protocol for bayan discovery.) 

Once added, you will receive a notification whenever a bayan is uploaded on any 
source. You can then open the app and download the bayan to your phone. 

Developers: 

Bayyina has been developed by Sunnah Academy (http://www.sunnahacademy.org) under 
the guidance of Shaykh Mustafa Kamal (db), who is authorized by Hazrat Shaykh 
Zulfiqar Ahmad Naqshbandi Mujaddidi (db) in the science of tasawwuf (Islamic 
spirituality). 

Limitations: 

Bayyina is a small app with limited features. We plan on making the current version 
stable before adding more features inshaallah. As such, please note the following: 

- Bayyina does not have bayan playback capabilities. It only allows downloading of 
bayans. You can then play them using any media player already available on your 
device. 

- Since Bayyina is under beta program, there will be bugs. Please report any to the
developers at bayyina@csrdu.org
